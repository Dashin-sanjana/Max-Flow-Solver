# Network Flow Solver - Max Flow Calculation (Edmonds-Karp Algorithm)

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project implements a solution for the **Network Flow Problem** using the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm** (BFS-based Ford-Fulkerson method).  
It calculates the **maximum flow** from a given **source node** to a **sink node** in a directed flow network.

This project was developed as part of the **Algorithms Coursework (5SENG003W)** for the **University of Westminster**.

---

## ðŸ›  Project Structure

- `Edge.java` â€” Represents directed edges with capacity and flow.
- `FlowNetwork.java` â€” Models the entire network using adjacency lists.
- `InputParser.java` â€” Parses input files to build flow networks.
- `MaxFlowSolver.java` â€” Computes the maximum flow using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
- `Main.java` â€” Main runner class that reads input and executes the solver.
- `benchmarks/` â€” Contains sample input files for testing.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Requirements
- Java 8 or later installed
- (Optional) IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code with Java extensions

### 2. Compile and Run

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
javac src/*.java
java -cp src Main
```

**Using IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code:**
- Open the project folder.
- Set `src/` as the source folder.
- Right-click on `Main.java` â†’ **Run**.

Make sure the input files (like `ladder_18.txt`) are in the correct directory (`benchmarks/`).

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input Format

The input file must be structured as:
```
<number_of_nodes>
<from_node> <to_node> <capacity>
<from_node> <to_node> <capacity>
...
```

**Example:**
```
4
0 1 6
0 2 4
1 2 2
1 3 3
2 3 5
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Output Example

```
Max Flow Calculation
âž• Augmented path found, flow added: 4, total flow: 4
âž• Augmented path found, flow added: 4, total flow: 8
Maximum flow from node 0 to node 3: 8
```

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Details

- **Algorithm**: Edmonds-Karp (Breadth-First Search based Ford-Fulkerson)
- **Time Complexity**: O(V Ã— EÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E)

## ðŸ›  Algorithm Flow (Edmonds-Karp)

```
Start
  â†“
Initialize total flow = 0
  â†“
While (there is an augmenting path from source to sink):
    â†“
  Perform BFS to find the shortest augmenting path
    â†“
  Find the bottleneck (minimum residual capacity)
    â†“
  Add bottleneck flow along the path
    â†“
  Update residual and reverse edges
  â†“
Add bottleneck to total flow
  â†“
Repeat
  â†“
No more augmenting paths
  â†“
End (Total flow is maximum)
```
